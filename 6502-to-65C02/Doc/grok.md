### Key Points
- It seems likely that a 74HCT245 bus transceiver is needed to convert TTL-level signals to CMOS levels for the W65C02S CPU, ensuring compatibility with the Commodore VIC-20's system.
- Research suggests the W65C02S requires a higher input high voltage (3.5V at 5V) compared to the NMOS 6502 (2.4V), potentially causing issues with existing bus signals.
- The evidence leans toward using the transceiver for reliable operation, especially in systems with TTL-compatible devices.

#### Why the Transceiver is Needed
The W65C02S, a CMOS device, has different electrical characteristics than the original NMOS 6502, particularly in input voltage requirements. The VIC-20's data bus likely uses TTL-level signals, which may not meet the W65C02S's higher threshold, risking unreliable operation. The 74HCT245 transceiver helps by converting these signals to appropriate CMOS levels.

#### How It Works
The 74HCT245 acts as a buffer, translating TTL outputs (e.g., 2.4V for high) to CMOS levels (e.g., above 3.5V for high), ensuring the W65C02S can correctly read data from the bus during operations like memory reads.

#### Supporting Evidence
Discussions on platforms like Retrocomputing Stack Exchange highlight that the W65C02S's datasheet indicates a need for level conversion, supported by adapter designs for the VIC-20 that include this transceiver ([Retrocomputing Stack Exchange](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/24665/is-the-w65c02s-ttl-compatible)).

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Replacing NMOS 6502 with W65C02S in Commodore VIC-20

This section provides a comprehensive examination of the technical considerations for replacing the NMOS 6502 CPU in a Commodore VIC-20 with a W65C02S, focusing on the necessity of a 74HCT245 bus transceiver for data bus signals. The analysis is grounded in electrical characteristics, system compatibility, and practical implementations, drawing from datasheets, forums, and adapter designs.

#### Background and Context
The Commodore VIC-20, a vintage 8-bit computer from the early 1980s, originally utilized an NMOS 6502 microprocessor. The W65C02S, a modern CMOS equivalent produced by Western Design Center, offers advantages such as lower power consumption and higher speed but introduces compatibility challenges due to differences in electrical specifications. The 74HCT245, an octal bus transceiver, is often recommended in adapter designs for this replacement, particularly for managing data bus signals.

#### Electrical Characteristics Comparison
To understand the need for a bus transceiver, we first compare the electrical characteristics of the NMOS 6502 and W65C02S, focusing on data bus parameters.

##### NMOS 6502 Data Bus Specifications
The NMOS 6502 datasheet ([MOS 6502 Datasheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029042234if_/http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/mos_6500_mpu_preliminary_may_1976.pdf)) provides the following for the data bus (D0-D7):
- **Output High Voltage (VOH):** ≥ Vss + 2.4V (at Iout = -100µA, Vcc = 4.75V, Vss = 0V), typically around 2.4V to 5V.
- **Output Low Voltage (VOL):** ≤ Vss + 0.4V (at Iout = 1.6mA), typically 0.4V max.
- **Input High Voltage (VIH):** ≥ Vss + 2.4V, with a threshold around 2.0V for TTL compatibility.
- **Input Low Voltage (VIL):** ≤ Vss + 0.4V, with a threshold around 0.8V for TTL.
- **Drive Capability:** Can drive one standard TTL load and 130pF, implying compatibility with TTL logic levels.

These specifications align with TTL standards, where VOH min is typically 2.4V and VIL max is 0.8V, making it suitable for systems designed around TTL devices.

##### W65C02S Data Bus Specifications
The W65C02S datasheet ([W65C02S Datasheet](https://eater.net/datasheets/w65c02s.pdf)) details the following for the data bus:
- **Output High Voltage (VOH):** ≥ VDD - 0.4V at Ioh = 700µA (for 5V ±5%, VDD = 4.75V to 5.25V), e.g., ≥ 4.35V at 4.75V.
- **Output Low Voltage (VOL):** ≤ 0.4V at Iol = 1.6mA (for 5V), similar to NMOS.
- **Input High Voltage (Vih):** ≥ VDD x 0.7, e.g., ≥ 3.5V at 5V VDD.
- **Input Low Voltage (Vil):** ≤ VDD x 0.3, e.g., ≤ 1.5V at 5V VDD.
- **Capacitance (Cin):** 5pF, lower than NMOS's 15pF typical.
- **Drive Strength:** Can source 700µA for high and sink 1.6mA for low at 5V, with reduced currents at lower voltages (e.g., 100µA source at 1.8V).

As a CMOS device, the W65C02S operates with rail-to-rail outputs (close to VDD for high, close to VSS for low) and has higher input thresholds, particularly Vih min of 3.5V at 5V, which exceeds TTL VOH levels (typically 2.4V to 3.6V depending on load).

#### Compatibility Challenges in the VIC-20
The Commodore VIC-20's system bus, including the data bus, is designed around the NMOS 6502 and likely incorporates TTL-compatible chips for memory, I/O, and the VIC video chip. During operations like CPU reads, these devices drive the data bus with TTL levels:
- High outputs (VOH) typically range from 2.4V to 3.6V, depending on load (e.g., 74LS TTL can output 2.7V at 20mA).
- Low outputs (VOL) are ≤ 0.4V, compatible with both NMOS and CMOS.

For the NMOS 6502, with VIH min = 2.4V, these levels are sufficient. However, for the W65C02S, Vih min = 3.5V at 5V means that a TTL device's VOH of 2.4V to 3.4V (under load) may fall below the required threshold, potentially causing the CPU to misinterpret high signals as low, leading to data errors.

#### Role of the 74HCT245 Bus Transceiver
The 74HCT245 is an octal bus transceiver with TTL-compatible inputs and CMOS-compatible outputs, making it ideal for level conversion:
- **Input Side (System Bus):** Accepts TTL levels, with VIH min = 2.0V and VIL max = 0.8V, matching the VIC-20's bus signals.
- **Output Side (CPU Side):** Drives CMOS levels, with VOH close to Vcc (e.g., 4.9V at 5V) and VOL close to 0V, ensuring Vih min = 3.5V is met for the W65C02S.

In practice, the transceiver is used in the direction from system to CPU during read cycles, buffering the data bus to ensure voltage levels are appropriate. It can also help with load management, as CMOS inputs draw less current (~20-40µA) compared to TTL inputs, reducing bus contention.

#### Practical Implementations and Evidence
Adapter boards, such as those documented on GitHub ([6502 to W65C02S Adapter](https://github.com/TheByteAttic/6502-to-W65C02S-adapter)), for the VIC-20 often include a 74HCT245. The documentation notes successful testing in VIC-20 motherboards, with the transceiver addressing latency and level conversion issues. Discussions on forums like Retrocomputing Stack Exchange ([Retrocomputing Stack Exchange](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/24665/is-the-w65c02s-ttl-compatible)) confirm that the W65C02S's datasheet indicates non-TTL compatibility, with users reporting the need for level matching to ensure reliable operation.

Additionally, the website [NMOS-CMOS 6502 Differences](https://wilsonminesco.com/NMOS-CMOSdif/) highlights that CMOS devices like the W65C02S have stronger bus-drive capabilities but require careful consideration of input thresholds, supporting the use of transceivers for noise immunity and level conversion.

#### Additional Considerations
- **Pin Differences:** The W65C02S has different pin functions (e.g., pin 1 is VPB, not Vss as in NMOS 6502), necessitating adapter boards to remap pins, which may integrate the transceiver.
- **Timing and Latency:** While the transceiver adds some latency (e.g., 3ns mentioned in [NMOS-CMOS 6502 Differences](https://wilsonminesco.com/NMOS-CMOSdif/)), this is typically negligible for the VIC-20's clock speeds (1-2MHz), but it caused issues in faster systems like the Apple //e.
- **Noise Immunity:** The W65C02S has negative noise immunity (-0.2V) with TTL VOH min = 2.4V, risking unreliable operation in noisy conditions, mitigated by the transceiver ensuring levels above 3.5V.

#### Conclusion
The 74HCT245 bus transceiver is essential when replacing the NMOS 6502 with a W65C02S in the Commodore VIC-20 to address the voltage level mismatch. The W65C02S's higher input high voltage requirement (3.5V at 5V) compared to the TTL-compatible NMOS 6502 (2.4V) necessitates level conversion to ensure reliable data bus operation, particularly during CPU reads. This is supported by adapter designs, datasheets, and community discussions, making the transceiver a critical component for compatibility.
