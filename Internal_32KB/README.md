# Internal 32KB RAM Expansion
Based on my working internal 8KB RAM replacement board.  This board adds a full 32KB internally to the VIC with the following features:
- RAM size can be switched externally: unexpanded, +3KB expanded, +32KB expanded (27.5KB available to BASIC);
- Fully reversible: no cutting of tracks or soldering of wires required;
- Reduces power consumption/waste heat.

## Purpose
- Save having to source replacement 2114 chips in case RAM is faulty;
- Upgrade the internal RAM unexpanded 5KB to a full 32KB, but switchable from outside the case depending on software requirements;
- Reduce power consumption/waste heat generation (reduced by just over 200mA, almost 20%);
- Use as a learning experience to understand how the VIC's memory works and using a PLD;
- 100% reversible, no cutting of tracks required.

## Important Note
This information is provided to you completely free - use at your own risk.<br>
It is assumed that you kind-of know what you're doing - it is tricky removing chips from the VIC-20 motherboard as the top-layer tracks can lift up if there is still solder attached, so please be very careful.<br>
I've been using the Japanese-made ENGINEER SS-03 solder sucker a lot lately and highly recommend it.<br>

## Design
The VIC's memory is allocated in eight 8KB blocks named BLK0 to BLK7.  The RAM is normally found in BLK0 to BLK3.

```

As per the existing VIC RAM design, we only want the RAM chip select to be active for these conditions:
- VA13 = high (when low the character ROM is selected), and
- BLK0 = low

All other combinations we want RAM chip select to be inactive.

Additionally, we want to be able to disable the full 8KB and return the VIC to its original "unexpanded VIC" state to avoid possible software compatibility issues.  The original 5KB of RAM is accessed when:
- A12 = high, or
- A10, A11, A12 = low

In its unexpanded state we should ignore all other combinations of A10 to A12.

The daughterboard is designed to plug in to the VIC's motherboard where two of the original 2114 chips were located - expectation is that all ten 2114 chips are removed, and two replaced with an IC socket.

The board itself is quite simple, using just the 6264 RAM chip and a PLD chip for the chip select logic.<br>

In order for the additional 3KB expansion to work we need to remove the 74LS138 RAM decoder (UC4 on my board) - its logic will be replaced by that in the PLD.<br>

Some wires need to be connected from the RAM board to where the [RAM decoder](/Internal_8KB/Images/VIC-20_internal_RAM_layout.png) was to pick up required signals:<br>
- VA10 from UC4 pin 1
- VA11 from UC4 pin 2
- VA12 from UC4 pin 3
- VA13 from UC4 pin 6
- /BLK0 from UC4 pin 4
- /RAM1 to UC4 pin 12
- /RAM2 to UC4 pin 13
- /RAM3 to UC4 pin 14

## BOM
- 6264 SRAM
- GAL16V8 (i.e. Atmel F16V8B)
- 10KÎ© pull-up resistor
- 2 x 100nF decoupling capacitor
- 2 x 18-pin DIP sockets (for UD4 & UE4 RAM locations)
- 4 x 9-pin SIL two-way pin headers (to plug into DIP sockets)
- 2 x 8-way pin header (for extra required signals)
- 2-way pin header (for 3KB expansion disable/enable)
- 1 x 16-pin DIP socket (for UC4 RAM decoder location)
- 8-way Dupont connector wiring

## Status
25-Apr-2025: Initial design done, checking-over before sending to PCBWAY for fabrication<br>
10-May-2025: Test PCB built & being tested<br>
11-May-2025: IT WORKS!  But, some small revisions to the board are required ...<br>
12-May-2025: Revisions to board made, new 74LS138 daughterboard created, might still tweak the design a little<br>
