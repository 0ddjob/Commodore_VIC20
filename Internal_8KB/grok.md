# Query 1 - Chip Select Logic

https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_e7b297fb-9c7c-4d09-af5e-45be8e58d914

To design the chip select logic for your 8KB RAM expansion using a 6264 RAM chip for the Commodore VIC-20, we need to create a circuit that activates the chip select (CS, active low) based on the given conditions for VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, BLK0, and the switch state. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and a suggested implementation.

---

### Requirements Summary
1. **Basic Chip Select Conditions**:
   - CS (active low) is active when:
     - VA13 = high (1)
     - BLK0 = low (0)

2. **Switch Behavior**:
   - **Switch ON**: The full 8KB is active, meaning CS is active regardless of VA10, VA11, VA12 values, as long as the basic conditions (VA13 = 1, BLK0 = 0) are met.
   - **Switch OFF**: CS is only active if the basic conditions are met AND one of the following address conditions is true:
     - VA12 = high (1), OR
     - VA10, VA11, VA12 are all low (0)

3. **6264 Pinout for Reference**:
   - The 6264 SRAM has a chip select (CS, active low, pin 20), write enable (WE, active low, pin 27), output enable (OE, active low, pin 22), and address lines (A0-A12).
   - We are only designing the logic for CS based on VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, and BLK0.

---

### Logic Design

Let's denote the switch state as SW (SW = 1 when ON, SW = 0 when OFF). The chip select (CS, active low) can be expressed as a Boolean equation based on the conditions.

#### Step 1: Basic Chip Select Condition
CS should be active (low) when:
- VA13 = 1
- BLK0 = 0

This can be written as:
```
Basic_CS = VA13 AND NOT(BLK0)
```
Since CS is active low, the output for this condition alone would be:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0)) = NOT(VA13) OR BLK0
```
However, this is only part of the logic, as we need to incorporate the switch and address conditions.

#### Step 2: Switch OFF Address Conditions
When SW = 0 (switch OFF), CS is only active if:
- VA12 = 1, OR
- VA10 = 0 AND VA11 = 0 AND VA12 = 0

This can be expressed as:
```
Address_Condition = VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))
```

#### Step 3: Switch ON Condition
When SW = 1 (switch ON), the address conditions (VA10, VA11, VA12) are ignored, and CS is active as long as the basic condition (VA13 = 1, BLK0 = 0) is met.

#### Step 4: Combine All Conditions
The full chip select logic can be written as:
- CS is active (low) when:
  - VA13 = 1 AND BLK0 = 0 AND (SW = 1 OR Address_Condition)

In Boolean terms:
```
CS_active = VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))))
```
Since CS is active low:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))))
```

#### Step 5: Simplify the Logic
To implement this efficiently, let's break it down:
- **Basic condition**: VA13 AND NOT(BLK0)
- **Address condition**: VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))
- **Switch logic**: SW OR Address_Condition

The final CS (active low) is:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))))
```

---

### Circuit Implementation

To implement this, you can use standard logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR). Here's a suggested circuit:

#### Components Needed
- **Inverters (NOT gates)**: For NOT(BLK0), NOT(VA10), NOT(VA11), NOT(VA12)
- **AND gates**: For multi-input AND operations
- **OR gates**: For combining conditions
- **NAND gates** (optional): To simplify active-low output

#### Step-by-Step Circuit
1. **Invert Signals**:
   - Use inverters to generate NOT(BLK0), NOT(VA10), NOT(VA11), NOT(VA12).

2. **Address Condition Logic**:
   - **NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)**:
     - Use a 3-input AND gate with inputs NOT(VA10), NOT(VA11), NOT(VA12).
     - Call this output `Low_Addr`.
   - **VA12 OR Low_Addr**:
     - Use a 2-input OR gate with inputs VA12 and Low_Addr.
     - Call this output `Addr_Cond`.

3. **Switch Logic**:
   - **SW OR Addr_Cond**:
     - Use a 2-input OR gate with inputs SW and Addr_Cond.
     - Call this output `Switch_Addr`.

4. **Basic Condition**:
   - **VA13 AND NOT(BLK0)**:
     - Use a 2-input AND gate with inputs VA13 and NOT(BLK0).
     - Call this output `Basic_Cond`.

5. **Final Chip Select**:
   - **Basic_Cond AND Switch_Addr**:
     - Use a 2-input AND gate with inputs Basic_Cond and Switch_Addr.
     - Call this output `CS_active`.
   - **CS (active low)**:
     - Use an inverter to invert CS_active to get CS, or use a NAND gate for the final AND operation to directly produce the active-low output.

#### Example with NAND Gates (for efficiency)
Since NAND gates are universal and often more compact, you can implement the entire logic using only NAND gates. Here's how:

- **NOT(x) = x NAND x**
- **AND = NOT(NAND)**: Use a NAND gate followed by an inverter (or another NAND gate).
- **OR = NOT(A NAND B) = NOT(A) NAND NOT(B)**

Let's rewrite the logic using De Morgan's theorem for NAND implementation:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))))
```
Using De Morgan's:
```
CS = NOT(VA13) OR BLK0 OR NOT(SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))))
```
```
NOT(SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))) = NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))
```
```
NOT(VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))) = NOT(VA12) AND NOT(NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))
```
```
NOT(NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)) = VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12
```
So:
```
NOT(VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))) = NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12)
```
Thus:
```
CS = NOT(VA13) OR BLK0 OR (NOT(SW) AND (NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12)))
```

This can be implemented with:
- NAND gates for AND operations
- NAND gates configured as OR gates (by inverting inputs)
- A final NAND gate to combine terms

#### Suggested ICs
- **74LS04**: Hex inverter for NOT gates
- **74LS08**: Quad 2-input AND gates
- **74LS32**: Quad 2-input OR gates
- **74LS00**: Quad 2-input NAND gates (for NAND-only implementation)
- **74LS11**: Triple 3-input AND gates (for Low_Addr)

---

### Address Space Mapping

To verify the design, let's map the address space:
- **BLK0**: On the VIC-20, BLK0 corresponds to addresses $0000-$03FF (1KB, but we're expanding to 8KB).
- **VA13 = 1**: This corresponds to addresses where A13 = 1, i.e., $2000 and above in the VIC-20's address space.
- **VA10, VA11, VA12**: These correspond to A10, A11, A12, defining 8KB blocks within BLK0 when expanded.

When SW = 1:
- The entire 8KB ($0000-$1FFF) is mapped, as long as VA13 = 1 and BLK0 = 0.

When SW = 0:
- CS is active only for:
  - **VA12 = 1**: Addresses where A12 = 1, i.e., $1000-$1FFF (4KB).
  - **VA10 = 0, VA11 = 0, VA12 = 0**: Addresses where A10 = 0, A11 = 0, A12 = 0, i.e., $0000-$03FF (1KB).

This effectively maps:
- $0000-$03FF (1KB, low addresses)
- $1000-$1FFF (4KB, high addresses)

Total: 5KB active when SW = 0, which aligns with partial RAM enablement.

---

### Notes
- **Power and Timing**: Ensure the 6264 SRAM is powered correctly (5V) and that propagation delays through the logic gates meet the VIC-20's timing requirements (1 MHz clock, ~1000 ns cycle time).
- **Switch Implementation**: The switch can be a physical toggle switch connected to a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10kΩ to 5V) and ground, producing SW = 1 (ON) or SW = 0 (OFF).
- **Decoupling**: Add a 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor near the 6264's power pins.
- **Unused Inputs**: Tie unused inputs (e.g., WE, OE) appropriately or connect them to the VIC-20's control signals (e.g., R/W for WE, phi2 for OE).

---

### Final Answer
The chip select logic for the 6264 is:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))))
```
Implement this using:
- Inverters for NOT(BLK0), NOT(VA10), NOT(VA11), NOT(VA12)
- A 3-input AND gate for NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)
- A 2-input OR gate for VA12 OR (above result)
- A 2-input OR gate for SW OR (above result)
- A 2-input AND gate for VA13 AND NOT(BLK0)
- A final 2-input AND gate, inverted to produce CS (active low)

Alternatively, use NAND gates for a compact implementation. The circuit maps 8KB ($0000-$1FFF) when the switch is ON, and 5KB ($0000-$03FF and $1000-$1FFF) when the switch is OFF, assuming VA13 = 1 and BLK0 = 0.

# Query 2 - Using a GAL

https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_1dfcf823-6794-47d5-9455-8b4549aa9b95

Yes, the chip select logic for your 8KB RAM expansion can be implemented using a **GAL (Generic Array Logic)** device, which is a programmable logic device (PLD) well-suited for small-scale combinatorial logic like this. A GAL, such as the popular **GAL16V8**, provides enough inputs, outputs, and programmable logic to handle the required chip select (CS) logic based on the input signals (VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, BLK0, and SW) and the specified conditions.

Below, I'll outline how to implement the logic using a GAL, including the Boolean equation, GAL configuration, and programming considerations.

---

### Logic Recap
The chip select (CS, active low) for the 6264 SRAM is defined by:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))))
```
This can be implemented in a GAL by:
1. Assigning input pins for VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, BLK0, and SW.
2. Defining the combinatorial logic for the CS output.
3. Programming the GAL to produce the active-low CS signal.

---

### GAL Selection
The **GAL16V8** is a good choice because:
- It has **8 inputs** (pins 2–9) and **8 outputs** (pins 12–19), with some pins configurable as inputs or outputs.
- It supports combinatorial logic with AND-OR structures in its Output Logic Macrocells (OLMCs).
- It is widely available, easy to program, and compatible with 5V systems like the VIC-20.

The GAL16V8 has:
- 10 dedicated input pins (1, 2–9, 11).
- 8 I/O pins (12–19), which can be configured as outputs or inputs.
- Each output macrocell supports up to 8 product terms (AND terms feeding an OR gate).

---

### Pin Assignment
For the logic, we need:
- **Inputs**: VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, BLK0, SW (6 inputs).
- **Output**: CS (1 output).

A possible pinout for the GAL16V8:
- Pin 1: Clock (not used, tie to GND or VCC for combinatorial logic).
- Pin 2: VA10
- Pin 3: VA11
- Pin 4: VA12
- Pin 5: VA13
- Pin 6: BLK0
- Pin 7: SW
- Pin 10: GND
- Pin 15: CS (output, active low)
- Pin 20: VCC (5V)
- Other pins (12–14, 16–19): Not used (tie to GND or leave unconnected, depending on programming tool).

---

### Logic Implementation in GAL

The GAL16V8 implements logic as a sum-of-products (OR of AND terms). We need to express the CS equation in a form suitable for the GAL's architecture.

#### Step 1: Simplify the CS Equation
The CS logic is:
```
CS = NOT(VA13 AND NOT(BLK0) AND (SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))))
```
Using De Morgan’s theorem to express it as a sum-of-products:
```
CS = NOT(VA13) OR BLK0 OR NOT(SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))))
```
```
NOT(SW OR (VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))) = NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)))
```
```
NOT(VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))) = NOT(VA12) AND NOT(NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))
```
```
NOT(NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12)) = VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12
```
So:
```
NOT(VA12 OR (NOT(VA10) AND NOT(VA11) AND NOT(VA12))) = NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12)
```
Thus:
```
NOT(SW OR ...) = NOT(SW) AND (NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12))
```
Final CS equation:
```
CS = NOT(VA13) OR BLK0 OR (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12))
```
Expand the last term:
```
NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12) = (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA10) OR (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA11) OR (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA12)
```
Since NOT(VA12) AND VA12 = 0, the last term drops out:
```
NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND (VA10 OR VA11 OR VA12) = (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA10) OR (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA11)
```
So:
```
CS = NOT(VA13) OR BLK0 OR (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA10) OR (NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA11)
```

This is now in sum-of-products form, suitable for the GAL:
- Product terms:
  1. NOT(VA13)
  2. BLK0
  3. NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA10
  4. NOT(SW) AND NOT(VA12) AND VA11

#### Step 2: GAL Programming
The GAL16V8’s output macrocell for CS (e.g., pin 15) can be programmed to produce the above logic. Each macrocell supports up to 8 product terms, and we only need 4, so this fits easily.

In **CUPL** or **WinCUPL** (common GAL programming languages), the logic can be written as:

```cupl
Name    VIC20_RAM_CS;
PartNo  GAL16V8;
Date    04/25/2025;
Revision 01;
Designer YourName;
Company  None;
Assembly None;
Location None;
Device   g16v8;

/* Inputs */
Pin 2 = VA10;
Pin 3 = VA11;
Pin 4 = VA12;
Pin 5 = VA13;
Pin 6 = BLK0;
Pin 7 = SW;

/* Outputs */
Pin 15 = CS;

/* Logic Equations */
CS = !VA13
   # BLK0
   # (!SW & !VA12 & VA10)
   # (!SW & !VA12 & VA11);
```

- `!` denotes NOT.
- `&` denotes AND.
- `#` denotes OR.
- The GAL16V8 will configure the output (CS) as active low by default, matching the 6264’s CS requirement.

#### Step 3: Active-Low Output
The GAL16V8 macrocell can be configured to produce an active-low output directly. In the GAL’s OLMC, set the output to “active low” (inverted output), which is standard for CS signals. This is handled automatically in the CUPL code above, as the equation defines the logic for CS being low when the conditions are met.

---

### Programming the GAL

1. **Tools Needed**:
   - **GAL Programmer**: A device like the TL866II Plus, GQ-4X, or a similar universal programmer that supports GAL16V8.
   - **Software**: WinCUPL (free from Microchip/Atmel) or OPAL to compile the CUPL code into a JEDEC file.
   - **JEDEC File**: The output of WinCUPL, which is loaded into the programmer to configure the GAL.

2. **Steps**:
   - Write the CUPL code as shown above.
   - Compile the code in WinCUPL to generate a JEDEC file (`.jed`).
   - Load the JEDEC file into the programmer software.
   - Insert the GAL16V8 into the programmer and burn the JEDEC file.
   - Verify the programming to ensure correctness.

3. **GAL16V8 Configuration**:
   - Ensure the GAL is set to **simple mode** (combinatorial output) in the macrocell for pin 15.
   - Disable the clock (pin 1) by tying it to GND or VCC, as this is combinatorial logic.
   - Program the GAL to use the specified pins and logic.

---

### Hardware Integration

- **Power**: Connect pin 20 to 5V and pin 10 to GND. Add a 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor across VCC and GND near the GAL.
- **Inputs**: Connect VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, BLK0, and SW to the assigned input pins (2–7).
  - For SW, use a toggle switch with a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10kΩ to 5V) and ground to produce SW = 1 (ON) or SW = 0 (OFF).
- **Output**: Connect pin 15 (CS) directly to the 6264’s CS pin (pin 20, active low).
- **Unused Pins**: Leave unused I/O pins (12–14, 16–19) unconnected or tie them to GND in the programmer software to avoid floating inputs.
- **Timing**: The GAL16V8 has a propagation delay of ~7–15 ns (depending on the speed grade, e.g., GAL16V8-15). This is fast enough for the VIC-20’s 1 MHz clock (~1000 ns cycle time).

---

### Advantages of Using a GAL
- **Compactness**: Replaces multiple discrete logic ICs (e.g., 74LS series gates) with a single chip.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to reprogram if logic changes are needed (e.g., adjusting address conditions).
- **Reliability**: Fewer components reduce points of failure.
- **Availability**: GAL16V8 is still produced (e.g., by Lattice Semiconductor) or available as NOS (new old stock).

---

### Notes
- **Fuse Map**: After compiling the CUPL code, check the fuse map in WinCUPL to ensure the logic fits within the GAL16V8’s 8 product terms per output. The current logic (4 product terms) is well within limits.
- **Testing**: After programming, test the GAL in-circuit with a logic probe or oscilloscope to verify CS goes low only under the specified conditions.
- **Alternatives**: If GAL16V8 is unavailable, a **GAL20V8** (more pins) or a small CPLD (e.g., ATF1502) could be used, but GAL16V8 is sufficient and simpler.
- **Erasure**: GAL16V8 is electrically erasable, so you can reprogram it multiple times without UV erasure (unlike PALs).

---

### Final Answer
Yes, the chip select logic can be implemented using a **GAL16V8**. The logic equation is:
```
CS = !VA13 # BLK0 # (!SW & !VA12 & VA10) # (!SW & !VA12 & VA11)
```
Use the following pinout:
- Inputs: VA10 (pin 2), VA11 (pin 3), VA12 (pin 4), VA13 (pin 5), BLK0 (pin 6), SW (pin 7).
- Output: CS (pin 15, active low).
- Power: VCC (pin 20, 5V), GND (pin 10).
- Tie pin 1 to GND or VCC.

Program the GAL using WinCUPL with the provided CUPL code and a GAL programmer. The GAL16V8 will produce the active-low CS signal for the 6264 SRAM, mapping 8KB ($0000-$1FFF) when SW = 1, and 5KB ($0000-$03FF and $1000-$1FFF) when SW = 0, assuming VA13 = 1 and BLK0 = 0.



https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_fda752f1-8676-4dd1-bb6c-ef6786c6e6c4

The **Output Enable (OE)** pin (pin 22, active low) on the 6264 SRAM controls when the chip's data outputs are active. For your 8KB RAM expansion in the Commodore VIC-20, the OE pin should be connected to ensure the 6264 outputs data only during read operations when the chip is selected. Here's how to connect it:

---

### Key Considerations
- The 6264 SRAM outputs data when:
  - **CS** (chip select, pin 20) is low.
  - **OE** (output enable, pin 22) is low.
  - **WE** (write enable, pin 27) is high (indicating a read operation).
- In the VIC-20, the relevant signals for controlling OE are:
  - **R/W** (read/write signal): High for read, low for write.
  - **Phi2** (phase 2 clock): The VIC-20’s 1 MHz clock signal, which qualifies memory access timing. Memory operations are valid when Phi2 is high.
- The OE pin should be active (low) only during read cycles when the 6264 is selected and Phi2 is high to ensure proper timing and avoid bus contention.

---

### Recommended Connection
Connect the **OE pin (pin 22)** of the 6264 to a signal that combines the VIC-20’s **R/W** and **Phi2** signals, ensuring OE is low only during valid read cycles.

#### Option 1: Simple Connection (R/W and Phi2)
- **Logic**: OE should be low when:
  - R/W = high (read operation).
  - Phi2 = high (valid memory access cycle).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a 2-input **AND gate** (e.g., 74LS08) with inputs R/W and Phi2.
  - Connect the AND gate output to the 6264’s OE pin.
  - Boolean equation: `OE = NOT(R/W AND Phi2)` (since OE is active low, invert the AND result).
- **Circuit**:
  - R/W (from VIC-20 expansion port or mainboard) → AND gate input 1.
  - Phi2 (from VIC-20 expansion port or mainboard) → AND gate input 2.
  - AND gate output → Inverter (e.g., 74LS04) → 6264 OE (pin 22).
  - Alternatively, use a **NAND gate** (e.g., 74LS00) to combine R/W and Phi2 directly, as NAND produces the active-low output: `OE = R/W NAND Phi2`.

#### Option 2: Incorporate Chip Select (CS)
- For added safety, you can ensure OE is only active when the 6264 is selected (CS is low).
- **Logic**: OE should be low when:
  - R/W = high.
  - Phi2 = high.
  - CS = low (from your GAL16V8 logic).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a 3-input **AND gate** (e.g., 74LS11) with inputs R/W, Phi2, and NOT(CS) (since CS is active low, invert it).
  - Connect the AND gate output to an inverter, or use a 3-input **NAND gate** (e.g., 74LS10) for a direct active-low output.
  - Boolean equation: `OE = NOT(R/W AND Phi2 AND NOT(CS))`.
- **Circuit**:
  - R/W → AND/NAND gate input 1.
  - Phi2 → AND/NAND gate input 2.
  - CS (from GAL16V8) → Inverter (74LS04) → AND/NAND gate input 3.
  - NAND gate output → 6264 OE (pin 22).

#### Option 3: Use Phi2 Directly
- In many VIC-20 designs, OE is simply tied to Phi2, as Phi2 is high during valid memory access cycles, and R/W controls whether the operation is read or write.
- **Implementation**:
  - Connect Phi2 directly to the 6264’s OE pin (pin 22).
  - Ensure WE (write enable) is properly driven by R/W (see below) to prevent output during write cycles.
- **Caveat**:
  - This assumes CS and WE are correctly managed to avoid bus contention.
  - If R/W switches late in the Phi2 cycle, there could be a brief period where OE is low during a write cycle, risking bus contention. Combining R/W with Phi2 (Option 1 or 2) is safer.

---

### Additional Notes
1. **Write Enable (WE) Connection**:
   - The 6264’s WE pin (pin 27, active low) should be connected to the VIC-20’s R/W signal, possibly qualified by Phi2 to ensure write operations occur only during valid cycles.
   - Simple approach: Connect WE to `NOT(R/W)` (use an inverter, e.g., 74LS04, or derive from a NAND gate).
   - Safer approach: WE = `NOT(R/W AND Phi2)` using a NAND gate, similar to OE.
   - Example: WE = R/W NAND Phi2 (same as OE in Option 1, ensuring read and write signals are synchronized).

2. **Bus Contention**:
   - To prevent the 6264 from driving the data bus during write cycles or when not selected:
     - Ensure CS is high (inactive) when the chip is not selected.
     - Ensure OE is high during write cycles (WE low) and when CS is high.
     - Option 2 (including CS in OE logic) provides the most robust protection.

3. **Timing**:
   - The VIC-20’s Phi2 clock is ~1 MHz, with a high period of ~500 ns. The 6264 (e.g., 6264-15) has an access time of ~150 ns, so the OE signal derived from Phi2 and R/W is fast enough.
   - Propagation delays through 74LS gates (~10–15 ns) or the GAL16V8 (~7–15 ns) are negligible compared to the VIC-20’s cycle time.

4. **Decoupling**:
   - Add a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor across the 6264’s VCC (pin 28) and GND (pin 14) to stabilize power.

5. **Signal Sources**:
   - **R/W** and **Phi2** are available on the VIC-20 expansion port (e.g., pins 10 and 12 on the 44-pin connector) or directly from the mainboard (e.g., near the 6502 CPU or VIC chip).
   - **CS** comes from the GAL16V8 output (pin 15, as designed previously).

6. **GAL16V8 Integration**:
   - If you want to generate OE within the GAL16V8 (to reduce external components), you can add OE as a second output:
     - Inputs: VA10, VA11, VA12, VA13, BLK0, SW, R/W, Phi2 (8 inputs).
     - Outputs: CS (pin 15), OE (pin 16).
     - CUPL code for OE:
       ```cupl
       Pin 8 = RW;    /* R/W input */
       Pin 9 = Phi2;  /* Phi2 input */
       Pin 16 = OE;   /* OE output */
       OE = !RW # !Phi2;  /* OE = NOT(R/W AND Phi2) */
       ```
     - This uses 1 product term for OE and fits within the GAL16V8’s capacity (CS uses 4 product terms, OE uses 1, total 5).
     - Update the CS logic as previously defined.

### Recommended Approach
**Option 1 (R/W and Phi2)** is the simplest and most common for VIC-20 RAM expansions:
- Connect OE to the output of a NAND gate (74LS00) with inputs R/W and Phi2.
- Circuit: `OE = R/W NAND Phi2`.
- This ensures OE is low only during read cycles when Phi2 is high, minimizing bus contention and aligning with VIC-20 timing.

If you prefer to integrate OE into the GAL16V8 to reduce components:
- Use the GAL16V8 to generate both CS and OE, with OE = `NOT(R/W AND Phi2)` as shown in the CUPL code above.

### Final Answer
Connect the 6264’s **OE pin (pin 22)** to the output of a **2-input NAND gate** (e.g., 74LS00) with inputs **R/W** and **Phi2** from the VIC-20. This produces `OE = R/W NAND Phi2`, ensuring OE is low only during read cycles when Phi2 is high. Alternatively, generate OE in the GAL16V8 by adding R/W and Phi2 as inputs and defining `OE = !RW # !Phi2` in the CUPL code, outputting OE on pin 16. Ensure WE is driven by `NOT(R/W)` or `R/W NAND Phi2` to prevent output during write cycles.
