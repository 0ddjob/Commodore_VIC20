This piece of hardware was released in 1984 by MFJ Enterprises.<br>

There is obviously no good reason to boot up your VIC-20, load the program and then measure a
capacitor ... there are much faster ways to do it.<br>

It is here mainly for education, showing how to interface software and hardware via the User Port.<br>

I have re-drawn the schematic from the physical board - it is currently UNTESTED!<br>

If I do get the board made and it works, I will update this README.<br>

All errors are my own.<br>
