## [6560/6561 A/V Breakout Board](/VIC_6560/)
The VIC's default video output is pretty bad.  I've long wanted to "go back to basics" and see how the output can be improved by, for example, wiring it up as per its original datasheet example circuit.<br>

The first step is to create this breakout board to isolate the A/V signals from the video output stage on the VIC's motherboard.<br>

I hope that it will allow me to see what signals the 6560 outputs natively, then start to build on that.<br>

BTW, yes I know there are boards out there that already do this.  I've not had much luck with the free or paid-for boards, so I want to ... TRY TO ... understand it myself.  Let's see ...
